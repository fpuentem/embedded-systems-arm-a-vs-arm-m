- RISC (Reduced Instruction Set Computing) Philosophy:
  - Simple, fixed-length instructions.
  - Load/Store architecture.
  - Emphasis on compiler optimization.
  - *Contrast*: CISC (Complex Instruction Set Computing) - more complex
    instructions, direct memory manipulation.
  - ARM's Business Model: Licenses IP cores to chip manufacturers
    (e.g., STMicroelectronics, NXP, Qualcomm).
  - ARM Cortex Profiles: Brief mention of -A, -R, -M. Focus on -A
    (Application Processors) and -M (Microcontrollers).

* Deep Dive into ARM Cortex-M
** ARM Cortex-M: The Microcontroller (MCU)
- A "computer on a chip" – CPU, Memory (Flash/RAM), and Peripherals
  all integrated onto a single silicon die.
- Key Architectural Features:
  - *Core:* Simpler pipeline, typically no MMU (Memory Management
    Unit). May include an MPU (Memory Protection Unit) for basic
    memory segmentation.
  - *Memory:* On-chip Flash for program storage (non-volatile), On-chip
    SRAM for data (volatile). Limited or no external memory
    capabilities.
  - *Peripherals:* Comprehensive set of integrated modules:
    - GPIO (General Purpose Input/Output)
    - ADC (Analog-to-Digital Converter), DAC (Digital-to-Analog Converter)
    - Timers, PWM (Pulse Width Modulation)
    - Communication Interfaces: UART, SPI, I2C, USB (device-side).
  - *Interrupts:* NVIC (Nested Vectored Interrupt Controller) – designed
    for low-latency, deterministic interrupt handling.

** ARM Cortex-M: Software & Characteristics
- *Operating System:*
  - *Bare-metal programming:* Direct hardware access, no OS overhead.
  - *RTOS (Real-Time Operating System):* e.g., FreeRTOS, Zephyr, Embox.
    - *Purpose*: Provides task scheduling, inter-task communication,
      resource management.
    - *Benefit*: Deterministic timing, small memory footprint.

** When to Choose Which? (Decision Flowchart)
- *Key Questions to Ask:*
  1. Does your application require a full operating system (file
     system, multiple processes, network stack, GUI)?
  2. Is highly precise, deterministic timing absolutely critical
     for safety or control?
  3. Are power consumption and cost the absolute highest
     priorities?
  4. Does it need to perform complex computations (e.g., AI,
     video processing)?
- *Hybrid Solutions*: Using an ARM-A for high-level tasks
  and an ARM-M as a co-processor for real-time control (e.g.,
  motor control on a drone).
